# Dataplex MCP Server

The Dataplex Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server gives AI-powered development tools the ability to work with your Google Cloud Dataplex Catalog. It supports searching and looking up entries and aspect types.

## Features

An editor configured to use the Dataplex MCP server can use its AI capabilities to help you:

- **Search Catalog** - Search for entries in Dataplex Catalog
- **Explore Metadata** - Lookup specific entries and search aspect types

## Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
*   A Google Cloud project with the **Dataplex API** enabled.
*   Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment.
*   IAM Permissions:
    *   Dataplex Viewer (`roles/dataplex.viewer`) or equivalent permissions to read catalog entries.

## Install & Configuration

1. In the Antigravity MCP Store, click the "Install" button.
    > [!NOTE]
    > On first use, the installation process automatically downloads and uses
    > [MCP Toolbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@toolbox-sdk/server)
    > `>=0.26.0`. To update MCP Toolbox, use:
    > ```npm i -g @toolbox-sdk/server@latest```
    > To always run the latest version, update the MCP server configuration to use:
    > ```npx -y @toolbox-sdk/server@latest --prebuilt dataplex```.

2. Add the required inputs in the configuration pop-up, then click "Save". You can update this configuration at any time in the "Configure" tab.

You'll now be able to see all enabled tools in the "Tools" tab.

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter issues with Windows Defender blocking the execution, you may need to configure an allowlist. See [Configure exclusions for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-exclusions-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide) for more details.

## Usage

Once configured, the MCP server will automatically provide Dataplex capabilities to your AI assistant. You can:

*   "Search for entries related to 'sales' in Dataplex."
*   "Look up details for the entry 'projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/entryGroups/my-group/entries/my-entry'."

    "dataplex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@toolbox-sdk/server", "--prebuilt", "dataplex", "--stdio"],
