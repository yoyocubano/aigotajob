## About

 `serverless-spark-cancel-batch` tool cancels a running Spark batch operation in
 a Google Cloud Serverless for Apache Spark source. The cancellation request is
 asynchronous, so the batch state will not change immediately after the tool
 returns; it can take a minute or so for the cancellation to be reflected.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [serverless-spark](../../sources/serverless-spark.md)

`serverless-spark-cancel-batch` accepts the following parameters:

- **`operation`** (required): The name of the operation to cancel. For example,
  for `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/operations/my-operation`, you
  would pass `my-operation`.

The tool inherits the `project` and `location` from the source configuration.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: cancel_spark_batch
type: serverless-spark-cancel-batch
source: my-serverless-spark-source
description: Use this tool to cancel a running serverless spark batch operation.
```

## Response Format

```json
"Cancelled [projects/my-project/regions/us-central1/operations/my-operation]."
```
