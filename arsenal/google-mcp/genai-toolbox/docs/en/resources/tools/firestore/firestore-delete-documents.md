## About

A `firestore-delete-documents` tool deletes multiple documents from Firestore by
their paths.
It's compatible with the following sources:

- [firestore](../../sources/firestore.md)

`firestore-delete-documents` takes one input parameter `documentPaths` which is
an array of document paths to delete. The tool uses Firestore's BulkWriter for
efficient batch deletion and returns the success status for each document.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: delete_user_documents
type: firestore-delete-documents
source: my-firestore-source
description: Use this tool to delete multiple documents from Firestore.
```
