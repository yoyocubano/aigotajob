## About

A `firestore-get-documents` tool retrieves multiple documents from Firestore by
their paths.
It's compatible with the following sources:

- [firestore](../../sources/firestore.md)

`firestore-get-documents` takes one input parameter `documentPaths` which is an
array of document paths, and returns the documents' data along with metadata
such as existence status, creation time, update time, and read time.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: get_user_documents
type: firestore-get-documents
source: my-firestore-source
description: Use this tool to retrieve multiple documents from Firestore.
```
