## About

A `mindsdb-sql` tool executes a pre-defined SQL statement against a MindsDB
federated database. It's compatible with any of the following sources:

- [mindsdb](../../sources/mindsdb.md)

The specified SQL statement is executed as a [prepared statement][mysql-prepare],
and expects parameters in the SQL query to be in the form of placeholders `?`.

This tool enables you to:

- **Query Multiple Datasources**: Execute parameterized SQL across hundreds of connected datasources
- **Cross-Datasource Joins**: Perform joins between different databases, APIs, and file systems
- **ML Model Predictions**: Query ML models as virtual tables for real-time predictions
- **Unstructured Data**: Query documents, images, and other unstructured data as structured tables
- **Federated Analytics**: Perform analytics across multiple datasources simultaneously
- **API Translation**: Automatically translate SQL queries into REST APIs, GraphQL, and native protocols

[mysql-prepare]: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/sql-prepared-statements.html

## Example Queries

### Cross-Datasource Analytics

```sql
-- Join Salesforce opportunities with GitHub activity
SELECT 
    s.opportunity_name,
    s.amount,
    g.repository_name,
    COUNT(g.commits) as commit_count
FROM salesforce.opportunities s
JOIN github.repositories g ON s.account_id = g.owner_id
WHERE s.stage = ?
GROUP BY s.opportunity_name, s.amount, g.repository_name;
```

### Email & Communication Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze email patterns with Slack activity
SELECT 
    e.sender,
    e.subject,
    s.channel_name,
    COUNT(s.messages) as message_count
FROM gmail.emails e
JOIN slack.messages s ON e.sender = s.user_name
WHERE e.date >= ?
GROUP BY e.sender, e.subject, s.channel_name;
```

### ML Model Predictions

```sql
-- Use ML model to predict customer churn
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    predicted_churn_probability,
    recommended_action
FROM customer_churn_model
WHERE predicted_churn_probability > ?;
```

### MongoDB Query

```sql
-- Query MongoDB collections as structured tables
SELECT 
    name,
    email,
    department,
    created_at
FROM mongodb.users
WHERE department = ?
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Example

> **Note:** This tool uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injections.
> Query parameters can be used as substitutes for arbitrary expressions.
> Parameters cannot be used as substitutes for identifiers, column names, table
> names, or other parts of the query.

```yaml
kind: tools
name: search_flights_by_number
type: mindsdb-sql
source: my-mindsdb-instance
statement: |
  SELECT * FROM flights
  WHERE airline = ?
  AND flight_number = ?
  LIMIT 10
description: |
  Use this tool to get information for a specific flight.
  Takes an airline code and flight number and returns info on the flight.
  Do NOT use this tool with a flight id. Do NOT guess an airline code or flight number.
  A airline code is a code for an airline service consisting of two-character
  airline designator and followed by flight number, which is 1 to 4 digit number.
  For example, if given CY 0123, the airline is "CY", and flight_number is "123".
  Another example for this is DL 1234, the airline is "DL", and flight_number is "1234".
  If the tool returns more than one option choose the date closes to today.
  Example:
  {{
      "airline": "CY",
      "flight_number": "888",
  }}
  Example:
  {{
      "airline": "DL",
      "flight_number": "1234",
  }}
parameters:
  - name: airline
    type: string
    description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier
  - name: flight_number
    type: string
    description: 1 to 4 digit number
```

### Example with Template Parameters

> **Note:** This tool allows direct modifications to the SQL statement,
> including identifiers, column names, and table names. **This makes it more
> vulnerable to SQL injections**. Using basic parameters only (see above) is
> recommended for performance and safety reasons. For more details, please check
> [templateParameters](../#template-parameters).

```yaml
kind: tools
name: list_table
type: mindsdb-sql
source: my-mindsdb-instance
statement: |
  SELECT * FROM {{.tableName}};
description: |
  Use this tool to list all information from a specific table.
  Example:
  {{
      "tableName": "flights",
  }}
templateParameters:
  - name: tableName
    type: string
    description: Table to select from
```
