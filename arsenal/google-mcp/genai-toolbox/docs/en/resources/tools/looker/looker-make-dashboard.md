## About

The `looker-make-dashboard` creates a dashboard in the user's
Looker personal folder.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [looker](../../sources/looker.md)

`looker-make-dashboard` takes three parameters:

1. the `title`
2. the `description`
3. an optional `folder` id. If not provided, the user's default folder will be used.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: make_dashboard
type: looker-make-dashboard
source: looker-source
description: |
  This tool creates a new, empty dashboard in Looker. Dashboards are stored
  in the user's personal folder, and the dashboard name must be unique.
  After creation, use `add_dashboard_filter` to add filters and
  `add_dashboard_element` to add content tiles.

  Required Parameters:
  - title (required): A unique title for the new dashboard.
  - description (required): A brief description of the dashboard's purpose.

  Output:
  A JSON object containing a link (`url`) to the newly created dashboard and
  its unique `id`. This `dashboard_id` is crucial for subsequent calls to
  `add_dashboard_filter` and `add_dashboard_element`.
```
