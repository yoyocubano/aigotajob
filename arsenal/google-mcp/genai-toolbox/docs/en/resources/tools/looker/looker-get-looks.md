## About

The `looker-get-looks` tool searches for a saved Look by
name or description.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [looker](../../sources/looker.md)

`looker-get-looks` takes four parameters, the `title`, `desc`, `limit`
and `offset`.

Title and description use SQL style wildcards and are case insensitive.

Limit and offset are used to page through a larger set of matches and
default to 100 and 0.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: get_looks
type: looker-get-looks
source: looker-source
description: |
  This tool searches for saved Looks (pre-defined queries and visualizations)
  in a Looker instance. It returns a list of JSON objects, each representing a Look.

  Search Parameters:
  - title (optional): Filter by Look title (supports wildcards).
  - folder_id (optional): Filter by the ID of the folder where the Look is saved.
  - user_id (optional): Filter by the ID of the user who created the Look.
  - description (optional): Filter by description content (supports wildcards).
  - id (optional): Filter by specific Look ID.
  - limit (optional): Maximum number of results to return. Defaults to a system limit.
  - offset (optional): Starting point for pagination.

  String Search Behavior:
  - Case-insensitive matching.
  - Supports SQL LIKE pattern match wildcards:
    - `%`: Matches any sequence of zero or more characters. (e.g., `"dan%"` matches "danger", "Danzig")
    - `_`: Matches any single character. (e.g., `"D_m%"` matches "Damage", "dump")
  - Special expressions for null checks:
    - `"IS NULL"`: Matches Looks where the field is null.
    - `"NOT NULL"`: Excludes Looks where the field is null.
```
