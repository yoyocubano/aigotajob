`action` parameter selects the type of check to perform:

- `check_db_connections`: Checks all database connections, runs supported tests,
  and reports query counts.
- `check_dashboard_performance`: Finds dashboards with slow running queries in
  the last 7 days.
- `check_dashboard_errors`: Lists dashboards with erroring queries in the last 7
  days.
- `check_explore_performance`: Lists the slowest explores in the last 7 days and
  reports average query runtime.
- `check_schedule_failures`: Lists schedules that have failed in the last 7
  days.
- `check_legacy_features`: Lists enabled legacy features. (*To note, this
  function is not available in Looker Core.*)

type: looker-health-pulse
source: looker-source
description: |
  This tool performs various health checks on a Looker instance.

  Parameters:
  - action (required): Specifies the type of health check to perform.
    Choose one of the following:
    - `check_db_connections`: Verifies database connectivity.
    - `check_dashboard_performance`: Assesses dashboard loading performance.
    - `check_dashboard_errors`: Identifies errors within dashboards.
    - `check_explore_performance`: Evaluates explore query performance.
    - `check_schedule_failures`: Reports on failed scheduled deliveries.
    - `check_legacy_features`: Checks for the usage of legacy features.

  Note on `check_legacy_features`:
  This action is exclusively available in Looker Core instances. If invoked
  on a non-Looker Core instance, it will return a notice rather than an error.
  This notice should be considered normal behavior and not an indication of an issue.
