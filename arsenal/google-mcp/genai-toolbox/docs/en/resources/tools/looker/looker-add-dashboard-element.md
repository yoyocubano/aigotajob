## Example

source: looker-source

  This tool creates a new tile (element) within an existing Looker dashboard.
  Tiles are added in the order this tool is called for a given `dashboard_id`.

  CRITICAL ORDER OF OPERATIONS:
  1. Create the dashboard using `make_dashboard`.
  2. Add any dashboard-level filters using `add_dashboard_filter`.
  3. Then, add elements (tiles) using this tool.

  Required Parameters:
  - dashboard_id: The ID of the target dashboard, obtained from `make_dashboard`.
  - model_name, explore_name, fields: These query parameters are inherited
    from the `query` tool and are required to define the data for the tile.

  Optional Parameters:
  - title: An optional title for the dashboard tile.
  - pivots, filters, sorts, limit, query_timezone: These query parameters are
    inherited from the `query` tool and can be used to customize the tile's query.
  - vis_config: A JSON object defining the visualization settings for this tile.
    The structure and options are the same as for the `query_url` tool's `vis_config`.

  Connecting to Dashboard Filters:
  A dashboard element can be connected to one or more dashboard filters (created with
  `add_dashboard_filter`). To do this, specify the `name` of the dashboard filter
  and the `field` from the element's query that the filter should apply to.
  The format for specifying the field is `view_name.field_name`.
```
