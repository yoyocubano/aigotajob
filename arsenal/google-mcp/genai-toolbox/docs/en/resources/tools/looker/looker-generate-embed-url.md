## About

The `looker-generate-embed-url` tool generates an embeddable URL for a given
piece of Looker content. The url generated is created for the user authenticated
to the Looker source. When opened in the browser it will create a Looker Embed
session.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [looker](../../sources/looker.md)

`looker-generate-embed-url` takes two parameters:

1. the `type` of content (e.g., "dashboards", "looks", "query-visualization")
2. the `id` of the content

It's recommended to use other tools from the Looker MCP toolbox with this tool
to do things like fetch dashboard id's, generate a query, etc that can be
supplied to this tool.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: generate_embed_url
type: looker-generate-embed-url
source: looker-source
description: |
