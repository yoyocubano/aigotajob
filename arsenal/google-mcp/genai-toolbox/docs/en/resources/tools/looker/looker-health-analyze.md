## About

The `looker-health-analyze` tool performs various analysis tasks on a Looker
instance. The `action` parameter selects the type of analysis to perform:

- `projects`: Analyzes all projects or a specified project, reporting on the
  number of models and view files, as well as Git connection and validation
  status.
- `models`: Analyzes all models or a specified model, providing a count of
  explores, unused explores, and total query counts.
- `explores`: Analyzes all explores or a specified explore, reporting on the
  number of joins, unused joins, fields, unused fields, and query counts. Being
  classified as **Unused** is determined by whether a field has been used as a
  field or filter within the past 90 days in production.
