## About

A `looker-conversational-analytics` tool allows you to ask questions about your
Looker data.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [looker](../../sources/looker.md)

`looker-conversational-analytics` accepts two parameters:

1. `user_query_with_context`: The question asked of the Conversational Analytics
   system.
2. `explore_references`: A list of one to five explores that can be queried to
   answer the question. The form of the entry is `[{"model": "model name",
   "explore": "explore name"}, ...]`

## Example

name: ask_data_insights
type: looker-conversational-analytics
source: looker-source

  Analytics API. You must provide a natural language query and a list of
  1 to 5 model and explore combinations (e.g. [{'model': 'the_model', 'explore': 'the_explore'}]).
  Use the 'get_models' and 'get_explores' tools to discover available models and explores.
```
