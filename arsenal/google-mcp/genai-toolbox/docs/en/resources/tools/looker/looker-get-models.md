## About

A `looker-get-models` tool returns all the models in the source.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- [looker](../../sources/looker.md)

`looker-get-models` accepts no parameters.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: get_models
type: looker-get-models
source: looker-source
description: |
  This tool retrieves a list of available LookML models in the Looker instance.
  LookML models define the data structure and relationships that users can query.
  The output includes details like the model's `name` and `label`, which are
  essential for subsequent calls to tools like `get_explores` or `query`.

  This tool takes no parameters.
```
