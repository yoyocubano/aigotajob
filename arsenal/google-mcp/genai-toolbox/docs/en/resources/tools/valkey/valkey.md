## About

A valkey tool executes a series of pre-defined Valkey commands against a
Valkey instance.

The specified Valkey commands are executed sequentially. Each command is
represented as a string array, where the first element is the command name
(e.g., SET, GET, HGETALL) and subsequent elements are its arguments.

### Dynamic Command Parameters

Command arguments can be templated using the `$variableName` annotation. The
array type parameters will be expanded once into multiple arguments. Take the
following config for example:

```yaml
  commands:
      - [SADD, userNames, $userNames] # Array will be flattened into multiple arguments.
  parameters:
    - name: userNames
      type: array
      description: The user names to be set.  
```

If the input is an array of strings `["Alice", "Sid", "Bob"]`,  The final command
to be executed after argument expansion will be `[SADD, userNames, Alice, Sid, Bob]`.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: user_data_tool
type: valkey
