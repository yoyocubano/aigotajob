## About

The `mongodb-delete-one` tool performs a destructive operation, deleting the
**first single document** that matches a specified filter from a MongoDB
collection.

If the filter matches multiple documents, only the first one found by the
database will be deleted. This tool is useful for removing specific entries,
such as a user account or a single item from an inventory based on a unique ID.

The tool returns the number of documents deleted, which will be either `1` if a
document was found and deleted, or `0` if no matching document was found.

This tool is compatible with the following source type:

* [`mongodb`](../../sources/mongodb.md)

## Example

Here is an example that deletes a specific user account from the `users`
collection by matching their unique email address. This is a permanent action.

```yaml
kind: tools
name: delete_user_account
type: mongodb-delete-one
source: my-mongo-source
description: Permanently deletes a user account by their email address.
database: user_data
collection: users
filterPayload: |
    { "email": {{json .email_address}} }
filterParams:
  - name: email_address
    type: string
    description: The email of the user account to delete.
```
