  A "mongodb-delete-many" tool deletes all documents from a MongoDB collection that match a filter.
aliases:

## About

The `mongodb-delete-many` tool performs a **bulk destructive operation**,
deleting **ALL** documents from a collection that match a specified filter.

The tool returns the total count of documents that were deleted. If the filter
does not match any documents (i.e., the deleted count is 0), the tool will
return an error.

This tool is compatible with the following source type:

* [`mongodb`](../../sources/mongodb.md)

---

## Example

Here is an example that performs a cleanup task by deleting all products from
the `inventory` collection that belong to a discontinued brand.

```yaml
kind: tools
name: retire_brand_products
type: mongodb-delete-many
source: my-mongo-source
description: Deletes all products from a specified discontinued brand.
database: ecommerce
collection: inventory
filterPayload: |
    { "brand_name": {{json .brand_to_delete}} }
filterParams:
  - name: brand_to_delete
    type: string
    description: The name of the discontinued brand whose products should be deleted.
```
