## About

The `postgres-replication-stats` tool queries pg_stat_replication to surface the status of connected replicas. It reports application_name, client address, connection and sync state, and human-readable lag sizes (sent, write, flush, replay, and total) computed using WAL LSN differences.

Compatible sources:

- [alloydb-postgres](../../sources/alloydb-pg.md)
- [cloud-sql-postgres](../../sources/cloud-sql-pg.md)
- [postgres](../../sources/postgres.md)

This tool takes no parameters. It returns a JSON array; each element represents a replication connection on the primary and includes lag metrics formatted by pg_size_pretty.

## Example

```yaml
kind: tools
name: replication_stats
type: postgres-replication-stats
source: postgres-source
description: "Lists replication connections and readable WAL lag metrics."
```

Example response element:

```json
{
  "pid": 12345,
  "usename": "replication_user",
  "application_name": "replica-1",
  "backend_xmin": "0/0",
  "client_addr": "10.0.0.7",
  "state": "streaming",
  "sync_state": "sync",
  "sent_lag": "1234 kB",
  "write_lag": "12 kB",
  "flush_lag": "0 bytes",
  "replay_lag": "0 bytes",
  "total_lag": "1234 kB"
}
```
