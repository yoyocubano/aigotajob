## About

A `wait` tool pauses execution for a specified duration. This can be useful in
workflows where a delay is needed between steps.

`wait` takes one input parameter `duration` which is a string representing the
time to wait (e.g., "10s", "2m", "1h").

{{< notice info >}}
This tool is intended for developer assistant workflows with human-in-the-loop
and shouldn't be used for production agents.
