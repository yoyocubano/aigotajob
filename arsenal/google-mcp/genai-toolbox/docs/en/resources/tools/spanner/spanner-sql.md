  Cloud Spanner database.

## About

A `spanner-sql` tool executes a pre-defined SQL statement (either `googlesql` or
`postgresql`) against a Cloud Spanner database. It's compatible with any of the
following sources:

- [spanner](../../sources/spanner.md)

### GoogleSQL

For the `googlesql` dialect, the specified SQL statement is executed as a [data
manipulation language (DML)][gsql-dml] statements, and specified parameters will
inserted according to their name: e.g. `@name`.

> **Note:** This tool uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injections.
> Query parameters can be used as substitutes for arbitrary expressions.
> Parameters cannot be used as substitutes for identifiers, column names, table
> names, or other parts of the query.

[gsql-dml]:
    https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax

### PostgreSQL

For the `postgresql` dialect, the specified SQL statement is executed as a [prepared
statement][pg-prepare], and specified parameters will be inserted according to
their position: e.g. `$1` will be the first parameter specified, `$2` will be
the second parameter, and so on.

[pg-prepare]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html

> Query parameters can be used as substitutes for arbitrary expressions.
> Parameters cannot be used as substitutes for identifiers, column names, table
> names, or other parts of the query.

kind: tools
name: search_flights_by_number
type: spanner-sql
source: my-spanner-instance
statement: |
  SELECT * FROM flights
  WHERE airline = @airline
  AND flight_number = @flight_number
  LIMIT 10
description: |
  Use this tool to get information for a specific flight.
  Takes an airline code and flight number and returns info on the flight.
  Do NOT use this tool with a flight id. Do NOT guess an airline code or flight number.
  A airline code is a code for an airline service consisting of two-character
  airline designator and followed by flight number, which is 1 to 4 digit number.
  For example, if given CY 0123, the airline is "CY", and flight_number is "123".
  Another example for this is DL 1234, the airline is "DL", and flight_number is "1234".
  If the tool returns more than one option choose the date closes to today.
  Example:
  {{
      "airline": "CY",
      "flight_number": "888",
  }}
  Example:
  {{
      "airline": "DL",
      "flight_number": "1234",
  }}
parameters:
  - name: airline
    type: string
    description: Airline unique 2 letter identifier
  - name: flight_number
    type: string
    description: 1 to 4 digit number

### Example with Template Parameters

> **Note:** This tool allows direct modifications to the SQL statement,
> including identifiers, column names, and table names. **This makes it more
> vulnerable to SQL injections**. Using basic parameters only (see above) is
> recommended for performance and safety reasons. For more details, please check
> [templateParameters](..#template-parameters).
