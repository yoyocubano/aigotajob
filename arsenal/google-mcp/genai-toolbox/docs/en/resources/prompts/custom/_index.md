Custom prompts are defined by the user to be exposed through their MCP server.
They are the default type for prompts.

## Examples

### Basic Prompt

Here is an example of a simple prompt that takes a single argument, code, and
asks an LLM to review it.

```yaml
kind: prompts
name: code_review
description: "Asks the LLM to analyze code quality and suggest improvements."
messages:
  - content: "Please review the following code for quality, correctness, and potential improvements: \n\n{{.code}}"
arguments:
  - name: "code"
    description: "The code to review"
```

### Multi-message prompt

You can define prompts with multiple messages to set up more complex
conversational contexts, like a role-playing scenario.

```yaml
kind: prompts
name: roleplay_scenario
description: "Sets up a roleplaying scenario with initial messages."
arguments:
  - name: "character"
    description: "The character the AI should embody."
  - name: "situation"
    description: "The initial situation for the roleplay."
messages:
  - role: "user"
    content: "Let's roleplay. You are {{.character}}. The situation is: {{.situation}}"
  - role: "assistant"
    content: "Okay, I understand. I am ready. What happens next?"
```
