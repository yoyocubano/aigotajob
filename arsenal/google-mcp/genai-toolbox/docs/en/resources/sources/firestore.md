# Firestore Source

[Firestore][firestore-docs] is a NoSQL document database built for automatic
scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. While the
Firestore interface has many of the same features as traditional databases,
as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships
between data objects.

If you are new to Firestore, you can [create a database and learn the
basics][firestore-quickstart].

## Requirements

### IAM Permissions

Firestore uses [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam-overview] to control
user and group access to Firestore resources. Toolbox will use your [Application
Default Credentials (ADC)][adc] to authorize and authenticate when interacting
with [Firestore][firestore-docs].

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure
the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for accessing
Firestore. Common roles include:

- `roles/datastore.user` - Read and write access to Firestore
- `roles/datastore.viewer` - Read-only access to Firestore
- `roles/firebaserules.admin` - Full management of Firebase Security Rules for
  Firestore. This role is required for operations that involve creating,
  updating, or managing Firestore security rules (see [Firebase Security Rules
  roles][firebaserules-roles])

See [Firestore access control][firestore-iam] for more information on
applying IAM permissions and roles to an identity.

### Database Selection

Firestore allows you to create multiple databases within a single project. Each
database is isolated from the others and has its own set of documents and
collections. If you don't specify a database in your configuration, the default
database named `(default)` will be used.

## Example

```yaml
kind: sources
name: my-firestore-source
type: "firestore"
project: "my-project-id"
# database: "my-database"  # Optional, defaults to "(default)"
```
