# Spanner Source

[Spanner][spanner-docs] is a fully managed, mission-critical database service
that brings together relational, graph, key-value, and search. It offers
transactional consistency at global scale, automatic, synchronous replication
for high availability, and support for two SQL dialects: GoogleSQL (ANSI 2011
with extensions) and PostgreSQL.

If you are new to Spanner, you can try to [create and query a database using
the Google Cloud console][spanner-quickstart].

## Available Tools

- [`spanner-sql`](../tools/spanner/spanner-sql.md)  
  Execute SQL on Google Cloud Spanner.

- [`spanner-execute-sql`](../tools/spanner/spanner-execute-sql.md)  
  Run structured and parameterized queries on Spanner.

- [`spanner-list-tables`](../tools/spanner/spanner-list-tables.md)  
  Retrieve schema information about tables in a Spanner database.

- [`spanner-list-graphs`](../tools/spanner/spanner-list-graphs.md)  
  Retrieve schema information about graphs in a Spanner database.

### Pre-built Configurations

- [Spanner using MCP](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/how-to/connect-ide/spanner_mcp/)  
Connect your IDE to Spanner using Toolbox.

## Requirements

### IAM Permissions

Spanner uses [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam-overview] to control
user and group access to Spanner resources at the project, Spanner instance, and
Spanner database levels. Toolbox will use your [Application Default Credentials
(ADC)][adc] to authorize and authenticate when interacting with Spanner.

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure
the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for the query
provided. See [Apply IAM roles][grant-permissions] for more information on
applying IAM permissions and roles to an identity.
