## About

[Oracle Database][oracle-docs] is a multi-model database management system
produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation. It is commonly used for running
online transaction processing (OLTP), data warehousing (DW), and mixed (OLTP &
DW) database workloads.

[oracle-docs]: https://www.oracle.com/database/

## Available Tools

- [`oracle-sql`](../tools/oracle/oracle-sql.md)
    Execute pre-defined prepared SQL queries in Oracle.

- [`oracle-execute-sql`](../tools/oracle/oracle-execute-sql.md)
    Run parameterized SQL queries in Oracle.

## Requirements

### Database User

This source uses standard authentication. You will need to [create an Oracle
user][oracle-users] to log in to the database with the necessary permissions.

    https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/21/sqlrf/CREATE-USER.html

### Oracle Driver Requirement (Conditional)

The Oracle source offers two connection drivers:

1. **Pure Go Driver (`useOCI: false`, default):** Uses the `go-ora` library.
   This driver is simpler and does not require any local Oracle software
   installation, but it **lacks support for advanced features** like Oracle
   Wallets or Kerberos authentication.

2. **OCI-Based Driver (`useOCI: true`):** Uses the `godror` library, which
   provides access to **advanced Oracle features** like Digital Wallet support.

If you set `useOCI: true`, you **must** install the **Oracle Instant Client**
libraries on the machine where this tool runs.

You can download the Instant Client from the official Oracle website: [Oracle
Instant Client
Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/downloads.html)

## Connection Methods

You can configure the connection to your Oracle database using one of the
following three methods. **You should only use one method** in your source
configuration.

### Basic Connection (Host/Port/Service Name)

This is the most straightforward method, where you provide the connection
details as separate fields:

- `host`: The IP address or hostname of the database server.
- `port`: The port number the Oracle listener is running on (typically 1521).
- `serviceName`: The service name for the database instance you wish to connect
  to.

### Connection String

As an alternative, you can provide all the connection details in a single
`connectionString`. This is a convenient way to consolidate the connection
information. The typical format is `hostname:port/servicename`.

### TNS Alias

For environments that use a `tnsnames.ora` configuration file, you can connect
using a TNS (Transparent Network Substrate) alias.

- `tnsAlias`: Specify the alias name defined in your `tnsnames.ora` file.
- `tnsAdmin` (Optional): If your configuration file is not in a standard
  location, you can use this field to provide the path to the directory
  containing it. This setting will override the `TNS_ADMIN` environment
  variable.

## Examples

This example demonstrates the four connection methods you could choose from:

```yaml
kind: sources
name: my-oracle-source
type: oracle

# --- Choose one connection method ---
# 1. Host, Port, and Service Name
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 1521
serviceName: XEPDB1

# 2. Direct Connection String
connectionString: "127.0.0.1:1521/XEPDB1"

# 3. TNS Alias (requires tnsnames.ora)
tnsAlias: "MY_DB_ALIAS"
tnsAdmin: "/opt/oracle/network/admin" # Optional: overrides TNS_ADMIN env var

user: ${USER_NAME}
password: ${PASSWORD}

# Optional: Set to true to use the OCI-based driver for advanced features (Requires Oracle Instant Client)
```

### Using an Oracle Wallet

Oracle Wallet allows you to store credentails used for database connection. Depending whether you are using an OCI-based driver, the wallet configuration is different.

#### Pure Go Driver (`useOCI: false`) - Oracle Wallet

The `go-ora` driver uses the `walletLocation` field to connect to a database secured with an Oracle Wallet without standard username and password.

```yaml
kind: sources
name: pure-go-wallet
type: oracle
connectionString: "127.0.0.1:1521/XEPDB1"
user: ${USER_NAME}
password: ${PASSWORD}
# The TNS Alias is often required to connect to a service registered in tnsnames.ora
tnsAlias: "SECURE_DB_ALIAS"
walletLocation: "/path/to/my/wallet/directory"
```

#### OCI-Based Driver (`useOCI: true`) - Oracle Wallet

For the OCI-based driver, wallet authentication is triggered by setting tnsAdmin to the wallet directory and connecting via a tnsAlias. 

```yaml
kind: sources
name: oci-wallet
type: oracle
connectionString: "127.0.0.1:1521/XEPDB1"
user: ${USER_NAME}
password: ${PASSWORD}
tnsAlias: "WALLET_DB_ALIAS"
tnsAdmin: "/opt/oracle/wallet" # Directory containing tnsnames.ora, sqlnet.ora, and wallet files
useOCI: true
```

{{< notice tip >}}
Use environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME}
instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.
