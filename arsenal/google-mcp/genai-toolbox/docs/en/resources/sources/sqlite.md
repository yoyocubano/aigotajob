## About

[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) is a software library that provides a relational
database management system. The lite in SQLite means lightweight in terms of
setup, database administration, and required resources.

SQLite has the following notable characteristics:

- Self-contained with no external dependencies
- Serverless - the SQLite library accesses its storage files directly
- Single database file that can be easily copied or moved
- Zero-configuration - no setup or administration needed
- Transactional with ACID properties

## Available Tools

- [`sqlite-sql`](../tools/sqlite/sqlite-sql.md)  
  Run SQL queries against a local SQLite database.
  
- [`sqlite-execute-sql`](../tools/sqlite/sqlite-execute-sql.md)  
  Run parameterized SQL statements in SQlite.

### Pre-built Configurations

- [SQLite using MCP](../../how-to/connect-ide/sqlite_mcp.md)  
Connect your IDE to SQlite using Toolbox.

## Requirements

### Database File

You need a SQLite database file. This can be:

- An existing database file
- A path where a new database file should be created
- `:memory:` for an in-memory database

## Example

```yaml
kind: sources
name: my-sqlite-db
type: "sqlite"
database: "/path/to/database.db"
```

For an in-memory database:

```yaml
kind: sources
name: my-sqlite-memory-db
type: "sqlite"
database: ":memory:"
```

### Connection Properties

SQLite connections are configured with these defaults for optimal performance:

- `MaxOpenConns`: 1 (SQLite only supports one writer at a time)
- `MaxIdleConns`: 1
