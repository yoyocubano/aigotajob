**⚠️ Best Effort Maintenance**

This integration is maintained on a best-effort basis by the project
team/community. While we strive to address issues and provide workarounds when
resources are available, there are no guaranteed response times or code fixes.

The automated integration tests for this module are currently non-functional or
failing.

## About

[Dgraph][dgraph-docs] is an open-source graph database. It is designed for
real-time workloads, horizontal scalability, and data flexibility. Implemented
as a distributed system, Dgraph processes queries in parallel to deliver the
fastest result.

This source can connect to either a self-managed Dgraph cluster or one hosted on
Dgraph Cloud. If you're new to Dgraph, the fastest way to get started is to
[sign up for Dgraph Cloud][dgraph-login].

[dgraph-docs]: https://dgraph.io/docs
[dgraph-login]: https://cloud.dgraph.io/login

## Available Tools

- [`dgraph-dql`](../tools/dgraph/dgraph-dql.md)  
  Run DQL (Dgraph Query Language) queries.

## Requirements

### Database User

When **connecting to a hosted Dgraph database**, this source uses the API key
for access. If you are using a dedicated environment, you will additionally need
the namespace and user credentials for that namespace.

For **connecting to a local or self-hosted Dgraph database**, use the namespace
and user credentials for that namespace.

## Example

```yaml
kind: sources
name: my-dgraph-source
type: dgraph
dgraphUrl: https://xxxx.cloud.dgraph.io
user: ${USER_NAME}
password: ${PASSWORD}
apiKey: ${API_KEY}
namespace : 0
```

{{< notice tip >}}
Use environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME}
instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.
