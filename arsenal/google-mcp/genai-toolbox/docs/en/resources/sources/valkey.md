## About

Valkey is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that originated as a
fork of Redis. It's designed to be used as a database, cache, and message
broker, supporting a wide range of data structures like strings, hashes, lists,
sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial
indexes with radius queries.

If you're new to Valkey, you can find installation and getting started guides on
the [official Valkey website](https://valkey.io/topics/quickstart/).

## Available Tools

- [`valkey`](../tools/valkey/valkey.md)  
  Issue Valkey (Redis-compatible) commands.

## Example

```yaml
kind: sources
name: my-valkey-instance
type: valkey
address:
  - 127.0.0.1:6379
username: ${YOUR_USERNAME}
password: ${YOUR_PASSWORD}
# database: 0
# useGCPIAM: false
# disableCache: false
```

{{< notice tip >}}
Use environment variable replacement with the format ${ENV_NAME}
instead of hardcoding your secrets into the configuration file.

### IAM Authentication

If you are using GCP's Memorystore for Valkey, you can connect using IAM
authentication. Grant your account the required [IAM role][iam] and set
`useGCPIAM` to `true`:

```yaml
kind: sources
name: my-valkey-instance
type: valkey
address:
  - 127.0.0.1:6379
useGCPIAM: true
```
