## Gemini CLI Extensions

[Gemini CLI][gemini-cli] is an open-source AI agent designed to assist with
development workflows by assisting with coding, debugging, data exploration, and
content creation. Its mission is to provide an agentic interface for interacting
with database and analytics services and popular open-source databases.

### How extensions work

Gemini CLI is highly extensible, allowing for the addition of new tools and
capabilities through extensions. You can load the extensions from a GitHub URL,
a local directory, or a configurable registry. They provide new tools, slash
commands, and prompts to assist with your workflow.

Use the Gemini CLI Extensions to load prebuilt or custom tools to interact with
your databases.
